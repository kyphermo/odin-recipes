    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One autumn evening in 1972, Grandma Rosa had unexpected guests and little time to prepare. With fresh pasta, creamy ricotta, and her homemade sauce, she layered everything into a dish and baked it to golden perfection. The result? A bubbling, cheesy masterpiece that left her guests speechless. From that night on, her baked ziti became a family tradition—a simple recipe made unforgettable with love and a dash of creativity. Now, you can bring a slice of Rosa’s magic to your table. Buon appetito!</p>
